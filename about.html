    <h2>History of the Library</h2>
    <p>Appomattox County Library had its beginning in 1936. It was a circulating library that contained 7,226 volumes for <br> whites and 6,045 volumes for black patrons, deposited in fifteen loan stations in private indexs throughout the county. <br>When the Library opened it was affiliated directly with the county schools.

The Library was made possible by David K. <br>Bruce. Mr. Bruce was a member of the Maryland legislature and the Virginia House of Delegates, and was <br>embassador to three nations: Great Britain, Germany, and France. He was also a lawyer, a writer, a farmer, and a <br>member of the Virginia State Library Board of Trustees.

As a patron of the arts, Mr. Bruce wanted to create a "true <br>university" through private financing of libaries in eleven counties. Each county received between twenty-five and <br>forty thousand dollars. The school board was responsible for the maintenance and operation of the library in <br>Appomattox. This Library was the only Bruce Library not recognized by the state as a public library.
<br>
<br>
On May 24, 1939 the Appomattox County Board of Supervisors met to consider hiring a county librarian. They pooled<br> resources with the Appomattox Town Council and the Superintendent of Schools to pay for a county librarian. It was <br>decided a library would be built near the high school and the school board would control the Library. On April 12, 1940 <br>the new library opened. The schools associated with the library were Appomattox County High School, Pamplin High <br>School, and Carver Training School.

A reception was held from eight-o'clock to eleven-o'clock P.M. on the opening<br> evening. Dignitaries at the event included C. W. Dickson Jr., Director of State Libraries, Judge J. W. Flood, Senator<br> Charles T. Moses, and Don Moses, Chairman of the Board of Supervisors.</p>
    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
