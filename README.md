The purpose of this capstone project created for Liberty University is to redesign the local library's website with WCAG in mind. 

This project aims to identify the need for and guide the development of a new website for the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library. The current website presents barriers to patrons seeking information and services, often resulting in unnecessary phone calls, emails, and in-person visits. The objective of this project is to improve the accessibility and usability of library resources through a modern, user-centric website. By incorporating intuitive navigation, detailed service descriptions, program information, and access to digital resources, the redesigned site will better serve both library patrons and staff. Additionally, the project will examine the technical requirements necessary to ensure the new site meets industry standards and best practices. Ultimately, the project seeks to create an online platform that embodies the libraryâ€™s mission of providing educational and informational services to the community.
